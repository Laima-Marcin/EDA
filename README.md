# EDA
Exploring population metadata

In this exercise, we are given a dataframe that describes a large dataset. Our goal is to perform EDA on the population in the dataset such that we can answer the following questions:

* How are the different diseases distributed in my dataset in terms of frequency and co-occurrence with one another? 
* How is age distributed across my dataset? Is it distributed differently for different diseases?
* How is sex distributed across my dataset? Is it distributed differently for different diseases?
* For findings that have a Mass_size (i.e. not just a binary classification of disease presence) is there a relationship between size and age, sex, or presence of other diseases?
